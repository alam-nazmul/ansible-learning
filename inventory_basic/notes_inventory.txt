```
[user@controlnode ~]$ ansible washington1.example.com --list-hosts
```


You can run the following command to list all hosts in a group:
```
[user@controlnode ~]$ ansible canada --list-hosts
```


[student@workstation ~]$ ansible ungrouped --list-hosts

[student@workstation ~]$ ansible webservers --list-hosts
