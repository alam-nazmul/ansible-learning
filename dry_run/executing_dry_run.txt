Executing a Dry Run
You can use the -C option to perform a dry run of the playbook execution. This causes Ansible to
report what changes would have occurred if the playbook were executed, but does not make any
actual changes to managed hosts.
The following example shows the dry run of a playbook containing a single task for ensuring that
the latest version of httpd package is installed on a managed host. Note that the dry run reports
that the task would effect a change on the managed host.
