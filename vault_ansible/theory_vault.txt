Ansible Vault, which is included with Ansible, can be used to encrypt and decrypt any structured
data file used by Ansible. To use Ansible Vault, a command-line tool named ansible-vault is
used to create, edit, encrypt, decrypt, and view files. Ansible Vault can encrypt any structured data
file used by Ansible. This might include inventory variables, included variable files in a playbook,
variable files passed as arguments when executing the playbook, or variables defined in Ansible
roles.


Ansible Vault does not implement its own cryptographic functions but rather uses
an external Python toolkit. Files are protected with symmetric encryption using
AES256 with a password as the secret key. Note that the way this is done has not
been formally audited by a third party.
