RUNNING AD HOC COMMANDS WITH ANSIBLE
An ad hoc command is a way of executing a single Ansible task quickly, one that you do not need to save to run again later.
They are simple, online operations that can be run without writing aplaybook.
Ad hoc commands are useful for quick tests and changes. For example, you can use an ad hoc
command to make sure that a certain line exists in the /etc/hosts file on a group of servers. You
could use another ad hoc command to efficiently restart a service on many different machines, or
to ensure that a particular software package is up-to-date.
Ad hoc commands are very useful for quickly performing simple tasks with Ansible. They do
have their limits, and in general you will want to use Ansible Playbooks to realize the full power of
Ansible. In many situations, however, ad hoc commands are exactly the tool you need to perform
simple tasks quickly.
